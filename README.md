Very simple spring boot application that works with an HTTP Client
via IntelliJ's HTTP Client or you can use Postman if using another IDE.

The Database that I used for this project was Postgres so make sure you have that
installed and update your application.properties file so that it matches the credentials
used in Postgres.
